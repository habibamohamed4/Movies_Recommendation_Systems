# Movies_Recommendation_Systems
In this project I implement a Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender system for films recommendations. Your goal in this problem is to implement a CF recommender system for recommending films from the file "movies.csv", based on user ratings found in "ratings.csv", Use the first 200 users only to generate the similarity matrix. You can only employ the 200 films within your analysis.
